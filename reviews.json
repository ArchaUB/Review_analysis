The noise cancellation barely makes a difference, and I can still hear a lot of background noise. The earbuds are also uncomfortable and keep falling out of my ears, making them impractical for workouts. Additionally, the touch controls are overly sensitive and frustrating to use. The charging case is flimsy and feels cheap. Not worth the price, in my opinion."

The battery life is much shorter than advertised, and I often find myself needing to recharge them multiple times a day. The connection is unstable and frequently drops, especially when I'm outdoors. The sound quality is subpar, with noticeable distortion at higher volumes. The earbuds are uncomfortable for extended use, and the build quality feels fragile. I've had better experiences with cheaper alternatives. Wouldn't recommend."

The ear hooks provide extra stability, and the touch controls are easy to use. The charging case is a bit bulkier than I'd like, but it's still pocket-friendly. The quick-charging feature is a lifesaver when I forget to charge them overnight. I'd recommend their armband phone case for a secure way to carry my phone during workouts."
